Excellent work!

You have successfully:
-   Deployed an application using a **Deployment**.
-   Exposed it with a **Service**.
-   Managed its configuration with a **ConfigMap**.
-   Diagnosed and fixed a failing application by inspecting pod logs and rebuilding a container image.

These are critical, day-to-day skills for anyone working with Kubernetes.
